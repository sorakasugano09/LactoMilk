            <h2>About The Milk Company</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>LactoMilk has been established to take advantage of the growing demand for milk and to consolidate
              potential
              procurement
              efficiency and R&D requirements. This allows LactoMilk to exert downward pressure on pricing with
              suppliers and
              bring a
              focused approach to R&D and product improvement, with the objective of ensuring the most advanced product
              applicable for
              the African market.</p>

            <h3>Our Research & Development and Quality Control capabilities</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Over 20 years our R&D team has continually worked with our suppliers to improve our products. Another
              benefit our
              Customers have is the quality control we provide. Centralising R&D and quality control reduces the
              otherwise unfocused
              and substantial cost of improving products and monitoring quality control.</p>

            <h3>Our Exclusivity Agreements with Suppliers</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>LactoMilk has negotiated exclusive agreements with some of its principal suppliers, which means that
              LactoMilk's
              specifications are
              not available to other companies, and in some cases the supplier will not sell to a LactoMilk or Customer
              competitor. LactoMilk
              sells these unique specifications as a branded product, and the brands have been trademarked. Hence, in
              reality the
              Customer's and third party customers' only potential supplier of the products LactoMilk sells is
              LactoMilk.</p>

            <h3>Procurement efficiencies & improved financial and credit terms</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Our centralised procurement of key raw materials enables our customers to focus their procurement on a
              select number of
              suppliers. Our greater volumes have enabled LactoMilk to negotiate improved terms from suppliers.
              Due to some suppliers choosing not to deal with some African countries without brokers or expensive credit
              insurance,
              LactoMilk is a favourable option which assists clients to save costs.</p>

        <h1>Benefits of partnering with LactoMilk…</h1>
        <h2>Competitive pricing</h2>
        <p>LactoMilk is able to achieve very competitive pricing from global milk powder suppliers and manufacturers of
          fat-filled milk
          powder which enables us to sell product to the Customers and third parties at competitive prices. LactoMilk
          purchases thousand
          of MT of milk powder per annum (full cream milk powder and fat filled milk powder) . LactoMilk is one of the
          largest
          single
          purchaser of fat-filled milk powder in the world, which gives LactoMilk buying power that few players in the
          market
          can match.</p>
        <h2>Sourcing and pricing</h2>
        <p>LactoMilk also provides a regular market analysis of the dairy market to its customers (Customers), which
          includes
          a forecast
          of future price movements. In order to do this competently LactoMilk has access to, and regularly reviews,
          dairy
          market
          information from a variety of sources e.g. news, dairy market publications, regular contact and discussions
          with other
          market players. Key information includes global political developments, the evaluation of price fluctuations
          and the
          current status of global demand and supply, including the stock positions of both suppliers and buyers.</p>
        <h2>Shipment</h2>
        <p>LactoMilk agrees shipment dates and schedules and places purchase orders on the suppliers. Further to this,
          LactoMilk
          also monitors
          shipments against the agreed schedules and follows up with suppliers when deliveries fall behind schedule.
          LactoMilk
          also
          negotiates better freight rates and freight times due to the improved pricing power.</p>
        <h2>Credit financing and stock insurance</h2>
        <p>LactoMilk provides credit terms to Customers and also assists when Customers experience liquidity problems,
          or are
          not able to
          source USD to pay for goods.*
          LactoMilk also provides cost effective stock throughput insurance.</p>
        <h2>Quality risk</h2>
        <p>LactoMilk bears all quality risk in relation to products sold to the Customers. In the event of a quality
          deficiency, LactoMilk with
          support from the R&D team, will liaise with the suppliers to correct any quality deficiencies. The suppliers
          will then
          compensate LactoMilk, who will then pass this on to its customers.” There has not been any instance where TMC
          was
          not
          compensated by the suppliers for a quality defect.</p>
        <h2>Product liability risk</h2>
        <p>TMC carries all the risk for products supplied by itself – i.e. LactoMilk is responsible for ensuring the
          products
          it supplies
          meet all quality requirements. If the Customers put a LactoMilk product into a formulation then that
          formulation
          becomes the
          risk of the Customer- i.e. it is the Customer’s responsibility to ensure that the specification meets the
          product
          requirements before they put it into a formulation.</p>
        <h2>Distribution and sales risk</h2>
        <p>LactoMilk is responsible for sourcing the product and distributing it to the Customers. The risk of problems
          occurring in the
          distribution chain remains the risk of TMC.</p>
        <h2>Country risk</h2>
        <p>Many suppliers are not allowed to sell products on credit directly to certain African countries. These
          suppliers would
          prefer to deal with a company based the Uzb, which is audited by a European or US. LactoMilk is
          audited by
          EY.</p>
        <h2>Foreign exchange risk</h2>
        <p>Businesses generally experience foreign exchange risk where they receive payment in a currency (or
          currencies) that is
          different from the currency in which they incur expenses. Foreign exchange risks relates to the possibility
          that
          currency exchange rates will vary over time.

          LactoMilk invoices the Customers in sum but purchases some of its products in another currency, e.g. EUR.
          Therefore,
          LactoMilk bears
          some of the foreign exchange risk</p>
